# Room Access Manager  
!["Project Icon"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nonelone/room_access_manager/master/icon.svg, "Room Access Manager")
RAM is a system for managing room access to rooms using NFC cards.  
I'm creating it as my bachelor's degree project.

Install dependencies using
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
Generate secret using `secrets.token_hex(16)` and put it in `secrets.txt`


Run the server using `python app.py`.  
On the first run, you will be prompted for user data for admin.  

LICENCES file was created using `pip-licenses`.
