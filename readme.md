# Room Access Management
RAM is a system for managing room access to rooms using NFC cards.  
I'm creating it as my bachelor's degree project.

Install dependencies using
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
Generate secret using `secrets.token_hex(16)` and put it in `secrets.txt`


Run the server using `python app.py`.  
On the first run you will be prompted for user data for admin.
